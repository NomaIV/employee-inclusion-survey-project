# Employee Inclusion Survey Project – Data Analytics Case Study

## Project Overview
This initiative addressed the exclusion of temporary employees from a global company's annual wellness survey at a manufacturing site. By implementing an inclusive data collection and tracking system, the project enabled 100% workforce participation while maintaining data anonymity and providing actionable insights through analysis and reporting.

## Business Challenge
- **Exclusionary process**: Temporary employees were omitted from the corporate wellness survey
- **Impact on engagement**: Led to decreased morale and sense of value among temporary staff
- **Incomplete analytics**: Management lacked comprehensive sentiment data across all employee groups
- **Manual inefficiencies**: No centralised system to track participation or analyse results efficiently

## Solution Implemented
1. **Microsoft Forms Survey** – Created an inclusive replica of the official survey
2. **Excel Participation Tracker** – Real-time monitoring of completion rates by department and date
3. **Anonymous Verification System** – Physical sign-off register maintaining respondent anonymity
4. **Centralised Data Repository** – SharePoint/OneDrive for stakeholder access and template reuse
5. **Analytics & Reporting** – Excel analysis transformed into PowerPoint insights for decision-makers

## Impact & Outcomes
- **100% workforce inclusion** achieved across all employee types
- **Improved sentiment metrics** among previously excluded groups
- **Enhanced data completeness** for site-wide analytics
- **Streamlined annual process** with reusable, documented templates
- **Increased stakeholder visibility** through structured reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Forms** – Survey design and distribution
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data tracking, analysis, and visualisation (see templates for formulas)
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** – Stakeholder reporting
- **SharePoint/OneDrive** – Document management and collaboration
- **Draw.io** – Process documentation and workflow mapping

### Data Flow Architecture
1. Employee data extraction from HR system → Excel tracker
2. Survey distribution via Microsoft Forms link
3. Anonymous completion with physical register verification
4. Data aggregation and analysis in Excel
5. Insight compilation in PowerPoint
6. Centralised storage on SharePoint for future reuse

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and insight generation
- **Process Design**: End-to-end data collection and management system
- **Stakeholder Management**: Multi-group collaboration and communication
- **Technical Proficiency**: Advanced Excel, Microsoft ecosystem integration
- **Business Impact**: Direct improvement in employee engagement metrics

## Future Considerations
While the current Microsoft-based solution effectively met requirements, potential enhancements for larger-scale implementations include:
- Database integration for improved data integrity
- Automated reporting through Python or Power BI
- Real-time dashboarding for continuous sentiment monitoring

## Project Status Note
This portfolio project is actively being enhanced with interactive samples. The analysis framework and participation tracking system documentation is complete, with sample data implementation in progress.
